# Anonymous GitHub Repository for GraphWorkload: Fast Dynamic Timing Analysis for Circuits with Graph Representation Learning

Welcome to our anonymous GitHub repository! This repository contains the inference code for the final **Joint Model** used in our paper. The code is divided into two parts: **7nm** and **45nm** technology nodes.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes the following:

- **Model parameter files (`.pth`)**: Weights for the Joint Model for both 7nm and 45nm process nodes.
- **Model architecture and hyperparameters**: Definitions of the model structure and the hyperparameters used during training.
- **Conda environment file**: Ensures consistent runtime environments for reproducing our results.

## Update Plan

Due to time constraints, only the inference-related resources are currently available. We are in the process of organizing the complete codebase, including training scripts and data preprocessing pipelines, and will upload them incrementally.
